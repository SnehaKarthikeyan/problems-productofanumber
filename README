# problems-productofanumber

Question:

You are given two positive integers x and y.
Your task is to find whether is it possible to represent x as the product of exactly y numbers.
For Example,
If x=8 and y=3 then x can be represented as 2 * 2 * 2= 8, so YES while x=5 and y=2 is not possible, so NO.

Input Description:

The only line of the input contains two integers x and y (1≤x≤10^9, 1≤y≤2⋅10^5).

Output Description:

If it is possible to represent x as the product of exactly y numbers, print YES otherwise NO.

Hints:

Traverse number list with a dynamic approach.

Sample Input:

120 5

Sample Output:

YES

Explanation:

As 120 can be represented by 2*3*2*5*2, hence output is YES.
